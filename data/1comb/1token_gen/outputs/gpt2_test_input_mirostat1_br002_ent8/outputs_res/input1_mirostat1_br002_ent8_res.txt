This is the instruction to understand a graph who represent a Tree plantation with irrigation. 
Node name Pumps with 3 positional variable and a pressur value (example Pumps1[X,Y,Z,P])
Node Pumps0 have always X=0, Y=0 and Z=0
Node Pumps have 1 output and 0 input 
Node name Tree (example Tree0[X,Y,Z])
Node must have 1 inputs and 0 or 1 output 
Edge are a pip with a Pression consumption to move the water between two node example “- (Pc)>
Two identifiers separated by a ‘->’  describe a graph  example (a -> b) 

Give an example of graph without other informations just a graph with 1 Pumps and 4 align Trees
